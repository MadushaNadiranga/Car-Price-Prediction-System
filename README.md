# Car Price Prediction System
 This project developed a machine learning powered car price prediction system as part of Computational Intelligence coursework. Using the 2025 Kaggle dataset, the system predicts prices based on attributes like brand, model, mileage, year, and fuel type. The process included data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and testing advanced regression algorithms, selecting the best model for deployment via a Flask web app. Key challenges included handling missing data and encoding categorical features, with special focus on brand and mileage effects. Achieving strong MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² scores, the system offers a functional, user friendly interface for real world price estimation.
